I am a PhD student at EPFL, advised by Volkan Cevher. I am currently interning at Amazon. I obtained an applied mathematics and machine learning master's (MVA) from ENS Paris-Saclay after studying stochastic processes and computer science at Telecom Paris.

I am broadly interested in randomness and computation. I have worked on the role of random noise on generalization, on the convergence to equilibrium of multi-agent games under limited feedback, and I'm currently interested in sampling and diffusion models.
