I am a PhD student at EPFL, advised by Volkan Cevher. I obtained an applied mathematics and machine learning master's from ENS Paris-Saclay after studying stochastic processes and computer science at Telecom Paris.


I am broadly interested in randomness and computation. I have worked on the role of random noise in generalization, on the convergence of randomized strategies in multi-agent games, and I'm currently interested in sampling and diffusion models.
